*"Whenever a large sample of chaotic elements are taken in hand and marshaled in the order of their magnitude, an unsuspected and most beautiful form of regularity proves to have been latent all along."*

-Sir Francis Galton

The Galton board consist of lots of **chaotic** (not random) ball bouncing events. After many individual seemingly unpredicable ball paths, a pattern starts to appear. This is the normal bell curve.
